You are running the `/generate` command for the buildSkillDocs plugin.

## Process

1. Read `sources.yaml` and `.cache/sync-state.yaml`

2. Determine which sources to extract:
   - No flags: sources where `extracted: false` or content changed
   - `--all`: all sources, ignoring hash check — always re-extract
   - `--topic <name>`: sources matching that topic (respects hash check unless combined with `--all`)
   - `--source <url>`: force re-extract this one specific source, ignoring hash check
   - `--source` + `--topic` can be combined but `--source` takes priority

3. If `--dry-run`: list sources that would be extracted and stop:
   ```
   Dry run — would extract:
     1. [doc] developer.android.com/topic/architecture → topic: architecture
     2. [repo] google/nowinandroid → topic: architecture

   Estimated token cost: ~47K tokens
   Run /generate (without --dry-run) to proceed.
   ```

4. For each source to extract:

   a. Determine the `source_slug` for the output file:
      - For doc sources: derive a slug from the URL (e.g., `developer.android.com/topic/architecture` → `android-architecture`, `medium.com/@someone/my-article` → `my-article`)
      - For repo sources: use the repo name part (e.g., `google/nowinandroid` → `nowinandroid`)

   b. **Check if content changed before extracting (save tokens):**
      - Fetch the page / check repo HEAD commit
      - Compute content hash (for docs) or get latest SHA (for repos)
      - Compare with stored hash/SHA in `.cache/sync-state.yaml`
      - **If unchanged AND knowledge file already exists:** skip extraction, just update `fetched_at`. Log "[unchanged] <source> — skipped extraction"
      - **If changed OR no knowledge file exists:** proceed with extraction
      - Note: `--all` flag bypasses this check and always extracts

   c. Ensure the topic directory exists: `knowledge/<topic>/`
      Create it if it doesn't exist.

   d. Spawn the `doc-extractor` agent with:
      - source_type, source_url, source_paths (if repo), source_priority, topic
      - source_slug: the derived slug
      - output_path: `knowledge/<topic>/<source-slug>.md`

   e. The agent writes the knowledge file directly to `knowledge/<topic>/<source-slug>.md`

   f. Update `.cache/sync-state.yaml`: store new `content_hash` or `last_commit`

5. After each community source is extracted, spawn the `source-verifier` agent with:
   - community_knowledge_file: `knowledge/<topic>/<source-slug>.md`
   - topic: the topic name
   - knowledge_dir: `knowledge/`

   Update the knowledge file's `<!-- Verified: ... -->` metadata header based on verifier results:
   - `overall_status: verified` → `<!-- Verified: trusted -->`
   - `overall_status: partial` → `<!-- Verified: partial -->`
   - `overall_status: rejected` → `<!-- Verified: rejected -->`

6. Update `.cache/sync-state.yaml` for each processed source:
   - Set `extracted: true`
   - Set `fetched_at: <today>`
   - Set `verified: <overall_status>` (for community sources)

7. Update `knowledge/index.md`: set Fresh column to `yes` for processed sources

8. Report results:
   ```
   Generated knowledge for N sources:
     - [extracted] architecture/android-architecture.md (12 rules, 4 patterns)
     - [extracted] architecture/nowinandroid.md (8 rules, 2 code snippets)
     - [extracted] concurrency/coroutines-guide.md (6 rules) [verified: partial]
     - [unchanged] navigation/android-navigation.md — content same, skipped

   Extracted: X | Unchanged (skipped): Y | Failed: Z

   Knowledge files ready. Commit and push to share with your team.
   ```

## Error handling

- If a source fetch fails (404, timeout): log warning, skip, continue with others
- HTTP 403/429 (rate limited): log "rate limited — try again later", skip
- If extraction produces empty or malformed output: keep previous knowledge file if one exists, report failure
- If source-verifier fails for a community source: keep `Verified: pending` in the knowledge file header, log warning
- Report partial results at the end
